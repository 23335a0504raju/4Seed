<h1>BUSINESS TIPS</h1>

<h2> REAL ESTATE BUSSINESS</h2>

<p>With the rise in the standard of living of the people and better-living
 facilities and amenities in demand, various brokers and firms have 
seen a steady rise in the business in recent years. You can jump in the wagon
 of this profitable business without
 worrying about the capital required to kickstart it.</p>
<p>What you need is the mindset that drives you to grab the
 opportunity that comes your way. All you need in the real estate business
 is to begin selling properties so that you can earn a return. Here are some of the 
ways you can implement your selling skills in 
the property business and start a business with zero investment.</p>

<h3>1. Collaborate with an investor</h3>

<p> the best way you can ensure that you close the deal is to partner with a property investor. Various investors have the capital and the will to invest in real
 estate but lack the administrative support to manage and 
execute the deal. Fill in the space of an administrator by handling
 the execution and finalising the deal. This way, both the investor and you can
 earn a profit with minimal efforts.
To get an investor interested to partner with you,
 the first thing that you need is commendable managerial skills. You should have
 complete knowledge regarding the technicalities of a real estate deal and should 
have the calibre to execute it impeccably.</p>


<h3>2. Grab Rent-to-Own Investments</h3>
<p> the person rents a property that they want to buy. As long as the lease
 of the property lasts, the buyer needs to pay a certain amount of rent. The perk that
 they get is that they have a 
right to buy the property before the end of the lease.

Through this option, you can grab a property that you believe to be
 promising for the future as you search for new properties to invest in.</p>

<h3>3. Using Leverage</h3>
<p>  If you own a property and are looking to begin a zero-investment business
 due to a lack of funds, then you can use the property you already own. You can borrow 
money from a money-lender or bank under the equity of your current property. With this
 money, you can buy a new property 
that has the promise to sell shortly.

 Ensure that the new property that you buy has enough potential
 to make a profit that exceeds the taxes and interest
 that you have you pay for the borrowed money. </p>


<h3>4. Lead Generation</h3>

<p>Find people who are looking to buy a property, people who are in the markett
 to sell or rent their property, etc. Once you create a considerable database, 
you can ensure that you have an influx of work at any point in time. Begin growing your network by browsing the internet and getting in touch with people who want to rent, buy, or sell a property. Ensure that as you grow, the quality of your leads and the 
kind of work they create keep improving as well.</p>

<h3>5. Act on Behalf of Developers</h3>
<p>Most developers do not sell their own property. This can create a true and tested 
zero investment business idea. You can contact the developer and act on their behalf
 to sell their property. The idea is especially profitable for people who live in
 an area or city that has a constant influx of new property and houses.

First, you will need to sign a contract with the developer. The contract should
 detail the rate of commission that you will receive after selling a property 
and other terms and conditions. To ensure that you earn considerable profit from such a
 deal, the first thing that you should ensure is a great marketing and advertorial
 skills. You should also have admirable communication skills to 
get enough people interested in buying the said property.</p>

<h3>6. Middleman</h3>
<p>Realtors are middlemen who hold the responsibility of getting the buyer and 
seller in touch. Realtors do not hold the accountability of the registration process
 and other formalities that come with signing a real estate deal. Once the deal between
 buyer and seller is signed, realtors receive a commission from the buyer. Acting as a
 realtor does not require any capital or personal investment. The role
 requires quality skills such as communication skills, great leads, and a network of
 sellers and buyers that ensure that the realtor always has an opportunity to get their 
profit.</p>


<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
Real estate is an ever-growing business. If you are still contemplating how to start
 a business in India, then the ways explained above can help you kickstart your business
 plan. These steps do not require any funds but they do require quick decision-making
 skills, soft skills, the ability to market and sell a property, and above all, hard work.
 A real estate business can prosper without the need for investment if one has the right skills 
and approach towards it.</p>









<h1>PHARAMACEUTICAL BUSSIESS</h1>
<h4> how to start pharamaeutical company</h4>
<p>Starting a manufacturing unit in the pharmaceutical sector involves
 setting up production, processing, packaging, storage, and logistics units. It is very
 important to have a strong understanding of the
 pharmaceutical sector to start and survive in this business.</p>
<h3>1. Diligent market research</h3> 
<p> When starting a third-party pharma manufacturing company or a small-scale business,
 conducting thorough market research is very important. Understand the working of the
 healthcare and the pharmaceutical sector in India and its performance in recent years.
 Analyse the different kinds of players that exist in this sector. Decide on what kind of
 manufacturer you would like to be; a branded pharma company, over-the-counter drug 
business, generic pharma, export-oriented business, etc. There are many categories and
 sub-segments that you can explore. Additionally, you can explore options like Ayurvedic
 medicines, allopathy, homeopathy, Siddha, and Unani, and decide which one works for you
 and interests you. Conducting a benchmarking study and market research will guide you in 
the right direction
 when you start the business.</p>


<h3>2. Understand the competition</h3>
<p>Understanding your competitors is as important as setting up your
 business. Analyse the market and understand what your competitor’s product offerings 
are and their business models. Jot down the best practices of the industry to help you 
run your business better. Analyse how your competitors perform at each step of the value
 chain and how you can enter and capture a significant chunk of the market for yourself.</p>



<h3>3. Develop a business plan</h3>
<p> Once you have done your research and competitor 
analysis, it is critical to prepare a detailed business plan covering all aspects
 of setting up a medicine manufacturing company. The most important thing, to begin 
with, is the capital required to start the business. Although drug manufacturing is a 
capital-intensive business, you can begin small. 
Like every business, you will have fixed and operating expenses.

You can plan to either own or outsource your manufacturing unit. There are certain
 rules and regulations which have to be adhered to before setting up the manufacturing
 unit. For this, it is necessary to have permission certificates and validation from 
the respective state departments. Setting up and launching a small business can cost 
you up to Rs. 5 to 10 lacs depending upon the size and complexity of the business. It is 
very important to have your financial plan ready for at least the next five years, along
 with the business strategy. Hire consultants who can help develop a detailed 
business plan and growth strategy for the next five years.</p>


<h3>4. Licensing & registration</h3>
<p>  Licensing is one of the crucial steps to focus
 on while setting up a pharmaceutical unit. This is one sector
 that is extremely sensitive and impacts people's lives. Therefore there 
is a huge responsibility on the part of the manufacturer. The number and type 
of licenses and registrations depend on the location of the plant and the type of business
 entity you are planning to register.

The common types of documentation you will need are
 drug manufacturing and distribution license, license for laboratory
 testing, NOC documents from respective departments, GST registration, and 
company registration. You will also need NOC and permissions from the State Pollution
 Control Board. If applicable, you might also 
need to apply for a clearance from the Drugs Controller General of India.

Opting to register your business under Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) 
registration unlocks several benefits. It is advisable for budding entrepreneurs to
 opt for a provisional certificate. There are many benefits, exemptions, and opportunities
 available to you if you are an MSME player.

</p>

<h3>5. Set up the machinery & the plant</h3>
<p>
From the production of the drugs to when it reaches the customers, 
the entire supply chain needs different types of tools and products. To manufacture
 these drugs, you will need high-speed mixing machines, capsule and powder filling
 machines, loading and capping units, air compressors and filtration machines,
 and other equipment.


Another important aspect of setting up a plant is having qualified technicians
 who have deeper domain knowledge and understand the medicine manufacturing process.
 You will need to hire resources specifically for these processes to ensure quality
 control and assurance. The technicians and the other staff have to align with Good
 Manufacturing Process (GMP) norms.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The pharma and healthcare sector is a major contributor
 to the Indian economy and is growing very rapidly. This is one sector where

 demand always exists, and the sensitivity is high. People are becoming more aware 
of the importance of preventive healthcare, and a significant chunk of the population 
is moving towards allopathy. With the pandemic making it more evident, the pharma
 business is one of the most profitable manufacturing businesses to start. According to a
 recent economic survey, the pharmaceutical sector is expected to grow 300% in the next
 ten years.</p>

<h1> to increase retail jewellery</h1>


<h3>ocus on specific segments</h3>
<p>Trying sell to everyone is a big strategic mistake. 
‍
Different segments have different needs. For instance,
 a woman in her late 20s, earning $47,000 a year would have
 different considerations when buying jewellery as compared to a
 45-year old woman who makes $125,000 a year. So, with the same strategy
 and approach, you cannot approach both of them, can you? 
‍
This is why targeting “everyone” is a mistake.
‍
Instead, pick a few select segments and then direct all your resources to target those segments. The conversion would be so much better. 
‍
In a way, carve for yourself a niche in the jewellery industry, wherein you specialize in catering to select segments.

<h3>ffer attractive discounts</h3>

<p> is very simple and straightforward.
‍
Introduce jewellery shop sales on 
your collection for new and old customers. 
‍
Make the discounts “urgent”; meaning, make them 
live for a limited-time period. 
‍
Thereon, make sure your target audience is aware of such discounts 
through marketing campaigns.</p>

<h3>Tain our sales team</h3>
<p>Selling is an art. If you looking out for 
how to increase jewellery sales? simply asking customers what they want and showing them that piece of jewellery doesn’t necessarily qualify as selling.

It’s much more tactical than that, which strives for
 a high close rate, better upsell, and a fantastic customer experience.
‍
So, train your sales team to be better at selling; train 
them to be better at delivering customers a great offline
 as well as an online jewellery shopping experience.
 This will generate greater benefits for you. </p>
<h3>
4.Tap on social media ads</h3>
Social media ads, if done correctly, can unlock your business’s exponential growth. 
‍
So, run ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
 Google, LinkedIn, Quora, and more. 
‍
Hire ad experts if needed. 
‍
Target the defined segments. Communicate with them through
 relevant content. Provide them with a better value proposition. Tell them about the limited-time discount on your jewellery collection.
‍
A small investment in ads promises a great ROI.</p>
<h3>
5. Focus on Building Brand</h3>
<p>
A visible and loved brand is among the most valuable assets
 a retail jeweller owns. Moreover, 59% of customers prefer to 
purchase new products from brands they know.

As a jewellery business, you could be locking horns with top brass
 with devoted customers and immeasurable marketing budgets. As such, you need to look for ways to shine - with your own solid brand-building approach.

But how to increase jewellery sales with branding?

Branding boils down to two high-level phases: building brand identity and 
building trust around that identity.

You should apply brand identity elements across all mediums uniformly. This includes
 your logo, website design, patterns and icons, colours and fonts, and ad campaigns.

Moving ahead, you can amplify the brand identity of your jewellery store effectively and nurture trust value around it through numerous digital marketing activities, like social media marketing, SEO & content marketing. paid advertising, and email marketing. Together, these measures are core to building a trusted brand.
</p>
<h3>
6. Personalize your communication</h3>
<p>
Personalization is one of the key tactics to drive higher conversion. 
‍
You need to communicate with prospects in their language. You must convey to them that you understand their needs and requirements; that you have the ideal piece of jewellery that matches their preferences and budget.
‍
Make the prospects feel important with your words and expressions.
‍
Personalizing their jewellery shopping experience, like they are talking to a friend who understands them, can drastically improve your conversion rate. This will help you close more deals quickly!
</p>
<h3>
7. Listen more (and better)</h3>
<p>
What are your customers saying? Do they not like your collection of necklaces or have an opinion on necklace online shopping? Do they wish for more discounts? Did they have trouble finding your store? Were they talking about the difficulty they had finding a parking spot outside your store?

Listening to customers can provide you with rich insights. You can translate these insights into actions and improve the different aspects of your jewellery business to scale your sales. 

</p>
<h3>
8. Don't Forget Existing Customers</h3>
<p>
Retaining an existing consumer is cheaper than engaging a new one. As per a survey, the success rate of selling to a current consumer is 60-70 per cent, while it’s just 5-20 per cent in the case of a new consumer.

Sadly, so many jewellery retailers focus too much on newer acquisitions, forgoing their existing customer base. Don’t be one of them!

Have a defined customer retention strategy that aims to keep the existing customers hooked to your brand and engaged with your offerings. Make sure they feel appreciated.
‍
Delivering a good experience to your existing customers can exponentially boost your conversion. Further, this can also trigger word-of-mouth marketing, bringing you greater rewards.
</p>
<h3>
9. Ask for feedback</h3>
<p>
You want to improve. You want to grow and take things to the next level... But you don’t know how to do that!

This is where getting feedback directly from customers can be incredibly helpful.

Request everyone who visits your website or physical store to take part in a survey. Ask them questions about your collection, your salesperson, pricing, marketing campaign, and various other aspects.

Gather up relevant data, identify gaps in your strategy, approach, and overall business, and then take definite steps to make improvements. 
</p>
<h3>
10. Embrace the AR solutions</h3>
<p>
Old ways won’t bring you new results
More and more jewellery brands are embracing augmented reality… and so should you!

AR solutions can be integrated into your sales channels and help you deliver customers a unique try-before-you-buy experience. This works in both models, whether you have an online jewellery shopping store or a physical showroom. 

Foremost, digitize your inventory. Second, in a physical store set-up, install screens where customers can look at themselves via camera and virtually try on the jewellery. In the online store set up, install an AR solution on the website that allows the visitors on the products’ page to virtually try on that product.

Augmented reality enhances engagement with the prospects. It provides them with an exciting and outstanding experience. This increases the chances of conversion. On top of that, it also adds to your brand value.

mirrAR is one of the leading names here, offering various AR solutions for jewellery business owners.
</p>
<h3>
11. Have a Growth Mindset</h3>
2020 spurred the decades-long progress of e-commerce and fundamentally transformed the way people discover and shop jewellery items. Ready or not, the future of jewellery shopping has come early.

The roles of online and in-store are blurring. As such, focus on smooth hybrid experiences that bring the best of online to the store, and vice versa, to fulfil customer expectations.

Considering the demand for a prompt brick-and-mortar experience, you need to offer the transactional conveniences and speed that customers are familiar with online shopping – from easy, customized selections to quick, seamless checkouts.

On the flip side, jewellers can leverage augmented reality (AR) to let customers imitate much of the physical store. With AR, customers can try on your jewellery piece on their smartphones and make efficient purchase decisions.
</p>
<h3>
12. Keep improving your collection</h3>
<p>
This goes without saying!
‍
To attract more customers and expand in different sub-markets, you need to continuously improve your jewellery collection.
‍
So, regularly audit your collection and improve it by adding newer
 varieties of jewellery or refining the existing ones.</p>
<h3>
Mistakes Jewellery Business Owners Should Avoid</h3>
(If you are looking to expand your jewellery business)
<p>
Many jewellers give preference only to the art of designing and creating jewellery pieces. But if you want to monetize that art and turn it into a sustainable business, you have to avoid making some common mistakes.

For instance, ignoring your customers’ preferences and thinking they will purchase only what you want them to purchase is a big mistake. Similarly, most jewellers get too upfront or sales when dealing with customers. This blocks their way of creating a rewarding customer relationship.

Moving forward, various small jewellery shop owners fill their shelves with all types of jewellery rather than focusing on in-trend jewellery design trends. Since customers want jewellery that’s in fashion, most of the collections end up with no buyers.

Furthermore, some new jewellers set any price they see fit and don’t consider various factors, like market demand and competitors’ prices. Worse, they don’t allow negotiation on those prices during checkouts thus repelling potential customers.

When looking for how to expand the jewellery business, you should avoid 
such practices that can put off the customers.</p>




<h1>clothing business</h1>
<h3>
1. Create your identity & choose a direction </h3>
<p>
Having a name for your clothing line is vital, but many people disregard the next most important thing which is positioning your brand in a certain market. You need to know who you are designing for and focus on one direction. If your clothing line is all dinosaurs, it wouldn’t make sense to have 10 t-rex shirts and then sell one shirt with a kitten on it.

From time to time, we see very consistent clothing lines have one or two off-beat designs thrown in just because they happen to like a certain animal, bike, creature, etc. If you want people to become familiar with your brand, they need to recognize it. So, be consistent across the board, showcasing your talent tastefully, while remaining iconic to your chosen industry.

Our piece on Comfort Colors showcases how their identity and quality products drives them forward. Once you have that strong identity it'll be easier to network—which is essential to growth.

If you want to switch it up a little but keep your identity, Johnny Cupcakes is a great example to follow. In the example below, their name or logo is present on each shirt to really hammer in brand recognition. Even though they went with a more playful approach for this line than what may be standard for the brand, they've managed to incorporate markers that signal to their core buying audience. The point here: Remember your audience, and keep it consistent.

Another great example of brand identity and consistency is Ugmonk. Their designs, though each unique, are all centered around the ideas of simplicity, minimalism, and sharp design. They do a great job of making designs that are different, but distinctly their own.
</p>
<h3>
2. Know your audience </h3>
<p>
First, you need to know what you are designing for. Is it a cause? Is it a sport? Is it a movement? Is it a hobby? Make it something you’re passionate about sticking with for the long haul. From there, you need to determine who you are designing for.

The best way to market a clothing brand is to know who will buy your product. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken to that have clothing lines and don’t know who they are selling to. If you don’t know which direction to take with your product or design, the first question you need to ask is “who is my target market?” A market for a fishing clothing line t-shirt might prefer a different fitting or feeling shirt than a group of people who are into high fashion. 

“A target market is a group of customers that the business has decided to aim its marketing efforts and ultimately its merchandise towards. A well-defined target market is the first element to a marketing strategy”

There are plenty of characteristics to consider: age range, gender, what activities or hobbies they are into, what trends are they easily attracted too, how quickly do they adapt to new styles, are they willing to spend a lot or a little money, where they currently shop, etc. A lot of the time when people buy custom t-shirts and other printed clothes, it’s about identity: they’re using your designs to tell the world who they are.

These are all important questions to figure out while creating and growing your brand. Just because you start with one market in mind, doesn’t mean that’s what your clothing line will forever be chained too. This might change over time as your line develops and matures. So ask questions to figure out what type of shirt your audience might prefer. Know and invest in the right audience and they will always invest in you.

3. Choose the right shirt</h3>
<p>
If wearing your shirt isn’t pleasurable, people won’t do it. So you need to pick out something that will delight with its feel as well as its looks.

T-shirts come in different styles, colors, fabric blends, weights and some even have tear-away tags. There’s a lot of choices - enough to stump you if you’re new to the custom tee game!

Once your line has been in the air a while, you’ll have sales data of your own to base these decisions on: if you sold five times more heavyweight than lightweight last year, it’s a good bet that heavyweight is where you should put your money this year. But when you’re just starting out you don’t have that data. How do you make decisions like this?

There are a couple of rules of thumb that should make things easier.

First, make sure you know your budget, so you are able to keep nice margins and make money while offering your customer a great quality shirt!

Second, we would recommend not going style crazy. You don’t need your design on every crew cut, tank, long sleeve and hoodie out there! Choose 1-2 styles at most and make sure your design resonates before you put all of your eggs in the same basket.

We usually find that it's better to offer more designs than styles. With all that said, keep seasons in mind. Winter is probably not the best time to launch your new line of custom tanks.

4. Research, research, research </h3>
<p>
Research, research & more research! Don’t just sell your product; know your product. There are so many different options available on the t-shirt printing side, you don’t want to short-change yourself by going with one style because you didn’t take the time or effort to look into other creative options that yield different results.

Take time to learn about the different screen sizes/print options available, the difference between water-based ink and plastisol ink, the different shirts available & the fabric composition of each, and specialty add-on services like custom printed tags, hem tags, and more. Everything from the design, to the feel, to how it’s delivered is going to matter to your client.

This is why partnering with the right printer can be so critical. Not all printers were created equal.

This is your business, your clothing line—your brand. Make sure the printer you pick is going to come along on this journey with you as you find your way. If they’re not scrupulous about quality and committed to excellence, it’s your reputation in their hands. Choose the printer you can build a great relationship with, that you can use as your resource hub, and who is going to come alongside you to celebrate your big wins!

5. Know your numbers </h3>
<p>
The initial investment
Designing retail-quality shirts (with all of the retail add-on bells & whistles that take your brand to the next level) can be expensive, but there are clever ways to keep costs down. Knowledge is power, so find out which t-shirts are most cost-effective based off the initial money you want to invest in your clothing line. If you are on a budget, you might not want to go with the most expensive blank garment there is—especially when there are plenty of great value options too.

You don’t have to start at the top. Work your way up! At the same time, you want to provide a high-quality product, so don’t just go with a shirt that isn’t soft or comfortable just because it’s cheaper. People won’t wear it, which means the buck stops there. If no one is wearing it, how will your brand ever grow? This is why research (and partnering with the right printer) is so critical to the initial success of your brand.

If you’re going full steam ahead and leaving your 9-5 to start this clothing line, it's important to realize that most businesses don’t let their founder draw a salary for the first year at least. Factor in living costs—including things like medical bills, insurance and so on—and be sure that you can deal with that before you jump. Alternatively, consider running on credit - but be aware that getting a business loan for a new business is really tough, and running your business on credit puts you under a lot of pressure. It's worth nothing that if you decide to run your new clothing start-up as a side project, you have a lot less pressure. But you’ll need to be disciplined with yourself about where you put your time when you have less of it to devote to your business.

Selling your shirts
You’ll also want to decide how much you want to sell your shirts for. A few things to keep in mind:

- How much did you pay for each one?

- Are you seeking to make a profit or just break even?

- How will you order more shirts if you are breaking even or making less that what you charged for them?

Again, know your audience, understand their budget, research what other similar clothing lines are selling their shirts for and make a decision.

6. Market your shirts</h3>
<p>
Okay, so, your shirts have arrived. Now what? Now you need to market the heck out of
 them (it’s actually best to have an action plan before the shirts arrive—maybe even
 pre-promote them before they drop to build momentum around the release!). Have you
 thought through your marketing strategy?
